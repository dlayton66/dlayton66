I'm a full-stack software developer with a background as a former professional poker player.  Recently I graduated from the ACCET-accredited backend program at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) in Ruby on Rails, as well as the [FastTrack](https://www.allaboutfasttrack.com/) full-stack program in Java/Spring and JavaScript/Angular.

I love coding on the side as well.  These days I'm helping design and maintain a match-making [Discord Bot](https://github.com/tribesonecommunity/discord-bots) written in Python, as well as working through [Full Stack open's course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) in React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript.

I'm currently looking for work as a back-end, front-end, or full-stack developer.  When I'm not coding, you can find me camping, gaming, or playing piano!
