I'm a former professional poker player who's transitioned to a career in software development.  I recently graduated from the ACCET-accredited backend program at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/), which focused on Ruby on Rails.  I also have experience with Python and C#.

Currently I'm looking for work as a back-end or full-stack engineer.  In the meantime, I'm keeping my backend skills sharp while also expanding into JavaScript with [Exercism's JavaScript path](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript).  You can track my progress with me below!

When I'm not coding, you can find me camping, gaming (currently Hades), or playing piano!
